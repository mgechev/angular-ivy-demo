     * Example:
     *
     * If we have a component and directive active an a single element as declared here

     * component:
     *   provides: [ {provide: String, useValue: 'component', multi: true} ],

     * providers: ['component', 'directive']
     * viewProviders: ['component', 'componentView', 'directive']

     * The way to think about it is that the `viewProviders` have been inserted after the component
     * but before the directives, which is why we need to know how many `multi`s have been declared by
     * the component.
