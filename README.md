# Angular Ivy Demo

This repository demonstrates simplified API for using Angular enabled by ivy.

## Overview

The entire application is within `index.html` and `index.ts`. The `index.ts` file contains two components and a pipe. There are two important points to notice:

- **There are no `@NgModule`s**
- **There are no zones**
- We don't use rxjs explicitly

This already reduces the learning curve dramatically by cutting three of the most misunderstood concepts in Angular.

## Usage

To try the demo:

```
git clone git@github.com:mgechev/angular-ivy-demo
cd angular-ivy-demo && npm i
npm start
```

Now open http://localhost:1234.

Try to create a "Hello, World!" application by:

* Create a file called `hello-world.html` with the following content:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<body>
    <app></app>
    <script src="compiler.umd.js"></script>
    <script src="hello-world.ts"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

* Create a file called `hello-world.ts` with the following content:

```typescript
import {Component, ÉµrenderComponent as renderComponent} from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app',
  template: 'Hello, World!'
})
class AppComponent {}

renderComponent(AppComponent);
```

* Run the following command:

```
./node_modules/.bin/parcel hello-world.html
```
